# Learning objectives
1. Understand and implement AI-based image segmentation methods for analyzing microscopy images, focusing on both supervised (U-Net) and unsupervised (W-Net) approaches.
2. Improve our skills in data preprocessing and model training using deep learning framework pytorch.
3. Evaluate and compare model performance based on metrics like IoU, accuracy and training/inference time to identify the strengths and weaknesses of each approch.
4. Explore how to develop supervised model from scratch.
5. Analyze and interpret results to provide insights into NK cell behavior and the possiblilty of AI-driven microscopy analyses as an alternative to traditional methods.
